## Topic
{: .title}

This project aims to distill knowledge from an existing large human-centric foundation model to create a (smaller) foundation model for multiple vision and language tasks involving humans​.

## Tasks
{: .title}

1. Run inference on multiple models to create a training dataset​
2. Implement a distillation architecture​
3. Train and evaluate model on one benchmark dataset​

## Expected Skills
{: .title}

1. PyTorch (required)​
2. Strong programming skills (required)​
3. Foundation Models, Knowledge Distillation, Contrastive Learning, Dataset Curation (preferred)​
