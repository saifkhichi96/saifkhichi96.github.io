## Topic
{: .title}

In this project, we will create a text-promptable pose estimation model that can be used to perform skeleton-agnostic human pose estimation. The goal is to dynamically modify the number of predicted keypoints at inference time in a zero-shot manner.

## Tasks
{: .title}

1. Prepare a text-image dataset suitable for training a zero-shot CAPE model tailored for humans only​
2. Model implementation and training​
3. Detailed performance comparisons

## Expected Skills
{: .title}

1. Strong programming skills + PyTorch (required) ​
2. Experience with human pose estimation (highly preferred) and MMPose (preferred)​
