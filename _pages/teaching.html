  <h3 class="title">About the Augmented Vision Lab</h3>
  <p>The Augmented Vision Lab at RPTU, led by <b>Prof. Dr. Didier Stricker</b>, is part of the Intelligent Systems faculty
    within the Department of Computer Science at RPTU Kaiserslautern. Affiliated with the Augmented Vision Group at
    DFKI, the lab offers students opportunities to engage in cutting-edge research through seminars, projects, and
    guided research each semester.</p>

  <h4 class="subtitle">Student Research Initiatives</h4>
  <p>Since 2023, I have actively supervised various student projects, working closely with students who are eager to
    explore innovative research topics. If you are a motivated student interested in collaborating on exciting projects,
    please reach out!</p>
