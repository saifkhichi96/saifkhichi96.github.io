Welcome to my education page! Here you can find information about my academic journey, including my degrees in Software Engineering and Computer Science, as well as my current pursuit of a PhD.

## PhD in Computer Science (2023 - Present)

I am currently a PhD candidate in Computer Science, focusing on __Motion Models for Robust Human Kinematics Capturing Using Deep Learning on Edge Devices__. As a research assistant, I am working with a team of professors and students to develop and refine this cutting-edge technology. I am thrilled to be a part of this project and am excited to contribute to the field of computer science.

## Master of Computer Science, TU Kaiserslautern (2019 - 2022)

I completed my Master's in Computer Science from the Technical University of Kaiserslautern, Germany. During my degree, I specialized in machine learning and computer vision, taking courses such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision. I also participated in several research projects, such as using deep learning for 3D reconstruction of textureless surfaces using a single RGB image.

## Bachelor of Software Engineering, NUST Pakistan (2014 - 2018)

I earned my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from the National University of Sciences and Technology in Pakistan. Throughout my degree, I focused on developing strong programming skills and took courses such as Data Structures and Algorithms, Software Design and Architecture, and Operating Systems. I also participated in [hackathons and coding competitions](/blog/team-doctor-phoenix-nust-pakathon-2015/), which helped me develop my problem-solving and teamwork skills.

I am proud of my academic achievements so far, and I am looking forward to continue learning and growing as a computer scientist.
