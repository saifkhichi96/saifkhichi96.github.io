Hey everyone,

Today I want to talk about something that's been on my mind for a while now - the tragedy of Karbala.

You know, there are some people out there who say that it's wrong to grieve for the martyrs of Karbala. But let me tell you, if you truly understand what happened on the banks of Euphrates on 7-10 Muharram 61 AH, your heart cannot help but ache with grief.

I mean, just think about Ali Asghar ibne Hussain (R.A). He was just six months old when he died from an arrow while Hussain (R.A) was holding him in his arms. Can you imagine the pain and heartbreak that must have caused?

And what about Ali Akbar ibne Hussain (R.A)? He called out the Azaan on the morning of Ashura, and it was the last Azaan he ever called out before he died in front of both his parents.

Then there's Ali ibne Hussain Zain ul Abideen (R.A), the sole male survivor of the Battle of Karbala. For twenty years after the battle, he would break down in tears whenever food was placed before him. Can you blame him? He had seen his entire family killed before his eyes.

Abbas ibne Ali (R.A), the brother of Hussain (R.A), lost both his arms, then his eye, and finally his life trying to get water from Euphrates for Sakinah binte Hussain (R.A) and other children who were three days thirsty. And speaking of Sakinah binte Hussain (R.A), Fatimah Kubra binte Hussain (R.A), and Zainab binte Ali (R.A), can you even begin to imagine the horrors they had to endure? Their hijabs were torn away, their tents and belongings were set on fire, and they had to witness the murders of their brothers, cousins, fathers, and uncles.

Qasim ibne Hassan (R.A), the 14-year-old nephew of Hussain (R.A), came to get his uncle's permission before going to fight Yazid's men. And let's not forget the 72 people who stood with Hussain (R.A) against the 30,000 men of Yazid.

And then there's Hussain (R.A) himself, killed while he was prostrating before Allah. This was the same Hussain (R.A) who used to ride on his nana's back while he was praying.

It's easy for some people to say that they don't grieve for the martyrs of Karbala. But the reality is that this was a tragedy too big for words. The victory of Islam that day came at a great cost - the lives of Hussain (R.A) and his companions, at the hands of people who claimed to follow the same religion as him.

So if you feel grief for the tragedy of Karbala, know that it's a natural and understandable emotion. And if you don't feel that grief, take some time to read and learn about what happened. I guarantee that once you truly understand the magnitude of the loss, your heart will ache with sorrow just like mine does.

Thanks for reading.
