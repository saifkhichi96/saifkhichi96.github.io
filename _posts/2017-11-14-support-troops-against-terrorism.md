As a Pakistani citizen, I strongly believe that we must support our troops in their fight against terrorism. In recent times, there has been an increase in terrorist activities, which has made people skeptical about the past and current military operations launched by Pakistan Army. But instead of questioning the effectiveness of these operations, we need to understand the challenges our troops face and support them in their fight against terrorism.

Our troops are fighting on the front lines, away from their families, and are deprived of comfort and basic necessities. They are not even sure if they will return home alive or if they will ever see their loved ones again. Yet, they continue to put their lives at risk to protect their country and its people.

As a citizen, it is our responsibility to provide our troops with the moral support they need. It is the least we can do for those who are putting themselves on the forefront of this war for us. We need to trust our troops and show them that we support them in their fight against terrorism.

There have been questions raised about the success of the military operations such as Rah-e-Nijaat, Zarb-e-Azb, and Radd-ul-Fasaad. But we need to understand that our troops are doing their best to stem the tide of terrorism. We cannot expect them to succeed completely in their mission, but we can at least acknowledge their efforts and support them.

We must also remember the sacrifices made by our troops in this fight against terrorism. They have given up their lives for the safety and security of our country. The least we can do is to support them and show them that their sacrifices have not gone in vain.

In my opinion, the key to defeating terrorism is to work together as a nation. We need to support our troops and provide them with the resources they need to fight this war. We also need to educate our children about the dangers of terrorism and the sacrifices made by our troops.

In conclusion, we must support our troops in their fight against terrorism. They are putting their lives at risk to protect us, and we must show them that we stand behind them. We cannot afford to be skeptical about their efforts. Instead, we need to trust them and provide them with the moral support they need to succeed in their mission.
