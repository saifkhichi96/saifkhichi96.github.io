                    <p>“They are not born. They are made. They are made just like anything else ... through hard work,
                        through patience, and through courage. They lead with passion. They instil hope, and
                        confidence.
                        They stamp out the fears, and encourage determination. They create a vision, articulate the
                        vision,
                        passionately own the vision, and unremittingly drive it to completion. Yes, they are the
                        leaders!” Sir Thomas Abbot stopped as the audience before him broke into vivacious clapping.</p>
                    <p>
                        His eyes swept the bright, prolific auditorium before him, taking in the young, eager faces,
                        all with
                        their eyes set on him. These kids were from distinguished institutions across the country, and
                        he was
                        here to brief them on the virtues of a leader. He was here to tell them what leadership was,
                        and he was
                        doing it with a vigour that belied his age. He could see the light in their eyes, and the
                        prospect of
                        providing his country with the very-much-indispensable leaders made him all the more resolute.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He smiled, coughed, before continuing,
                    </p>
                    <p>“A leader, in essence, is a dreamer. But a dreamer who struggles through every thick and thin,
                        seeing
                        the silver lining in every cloud, and rests only when he has achieved what he dreamt. To be
                        able
                        to lead others, a man must be preparedto go to the foreunaccompanied, because leaders don't
                        wait;
                        they shape their own frontiers. The bigger the challengeis, the greater is the opportunity. And
                        they
                        see it. Fear stops you in your tracks. Self-assurancepropels you forward. You have to believe
                        in
                        yourself, becauseit is hard to beat a person who never gives up. Strong-minded,
                        resolutely-willed,
                        you can create out of nothing animmensebusiness, a giganticempire, a New World!” his voice
                        reverberated around the hall, as the promising youngsters sat there, their faces screwed up in
                        concentration, clinging to every word that left his mouth, as if their life depended on it.
                        Some had their camcorders out, others were moving their hands with such amazing speeds that
                        their hands
                        were a blur, writing down all that he said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His eyes lit up with pride and emotions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He stopped to catch his breath, before going on, slower this time, “Do you remember Martin
                        Luther King
                        Jr.?
                        He had a dream. We all have dreams. But his dream, it was different. Why? Because he believed
                        he could
                        accomplish it, and he did. Do you remember Abraham Lincoln? Winston Churchill? Mahatma Gandhi?
                        Mohammad
                        Ali
                        Jinnah? They all had one thing in common – determination, a determination that never faltered,
                        a resolve
                        that never wavered, and a will to attain what they sought. All who have accomplished great
                        things have
                        had
                        a great aim; had fixed their gaze on a goal which was high, one which sometimes even seemed
                        impossible.
                        But
                        they achieved it, simply by knowing that difference between the impossible and possible lies in
                        a
                        person's
                        determination.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He had to stop, as the hall had once again burst into vigorous round of applause. It took them
                        a moment
                        to settle again. He sighed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Leaders need to have influence on their people. What makes leadership is the ability to get
                        people
                        to do what they don't want to do, and like it. As a leader you should always start with where
                        people are
                        before you try to take them to where you want them to go. Just like a good manager is a man who
                        isn't
                        worried about his own career but rather the careers of those who work for him, a good leader is
                        a man
                        who rejoices the success of those who look up to him. A good leader is a man who brings people
                        up - not
                        down! A good leader is a man who seizes every opportunity to give encouragement, because
                        encouragement
                        is oxygen to the soul.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whole room was lit by glares of flashlights, and he was, for an instant, blinded by the sudden
                        onslaught
                        from every direction. He closed his eyes, removed his eyeglasses, and wiped his forehead with
                        the back
                        of his wrinkled hand. Putting his glasses back on, he took a swig from the glass of water on
                        the dais
                        before him. Age had its tolls. His feet already felt heavier, but he smiled softly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Leadership is not a one-day thing. It is a constant commitment to excellence, a habit . . . a
                        daily
                        practice. Challenge yourself all the days of your life. Plunge boldly into the thicket of life!
                        Either
                        find a way or make one. The will to win is worthless if you do not have the will to prepare.
                        Lead by
                        example! Exceed expectations! Move. Whatever it takes, just move! Don't let anything stop you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There will be times when you'll be disappointed, but you can't stop. Make yourself the very
                        best that
                        you can! The challenge may not be easy, but it is possible. What you need is boldness, more
                        boldness,
                        and always boldness!” and with that, he finished.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As he turned around to make his way to his seat, the auditorium rang with fervent clapping and
                        cheering.
                        There were many flashes of light, again. It made him smile, broadly. He sat on his seat,
                        thinking. He
                        had done his job, and hopefully, his effort would not be fruitless. At 71, he was too old to
                        take the
                        job anymore. It was time of the young ones. They needed to be prepared, because their country
                        needed
                        them, and he had done something to contribute to the cause.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When he exited the hall, an hour or so later, during which he had been asked for autographs
                        quite a few
                        times, he wore a satisfied grin on his face, which lit his face in a way that made him look ten
                        years
                        younger.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before the sun rose on the next day, the newsstands and the hawkers began selling the papers,
                        and with
                        those, came the shocking news, on the front page of every paper, right beneath the benevolently
                        smiling
                        face of Sir Thomas Abbot from the day before, of his demise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He had fallen asleep last night, content, satisfied, and hopeful, never to wake up again. That
                        evening,
                        the city’s graveyard witnessed the greatest service ever in the history, as hundreds of
                        black-clad
                        mourners gathered to see him to his very last abode, with eyes cast down, drenched in rain,
                        which
                        disguised the tears streaming down their faces. As the sun sat that day, the words,“Here lies
                        Sir Thomas
                        Abbot, the dreamer who left behind a legacy of true leadership” glowed blood-red in the
                        departing rays.
