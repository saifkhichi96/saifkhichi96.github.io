            <p>“They are not born. They are made. They are made just like anything else ... through hard work,
                through patience, and through courage. They lead with passion. They instil hope, and confidence.
                They stamp out the fears, and encourage determination. They create a vision, articulate the vision,
                passionately own the vision, and unremittingly drive it to completion. Yes, they are the
                leaders!” Sir Thomas Abbot stopped as the audience before him broke into vivacious clapping.</p>
            <p>
                His eyes swept the bright, prolific auditorium before him, taking in the young, eager faces, all with
                their eyes set on him. These kids were from distinguished institutions across the country, and he was
                here to brief them on the virtues of a leader. He was here to tell them what leadership was, and he was
                doing it with a vigour that belied his age. He could see the light in their eyes, and the prospect of
                providing his country with the very-much-indispensable leaders made him all the more resolute.
            </p>
            <p>
                He smiled, coughed, before continuing,
            </p>
            <p>“A leader, in essence, is a dreamer. But a dreamer who struggles through every thick and thin, seeing
                the silver lining in every cloud, and rests only when he has achieved what he dreamt. To be able
                to lead others, a man must be preparedto go to the foreunaccompanied, because leaders don't wait;
                they shape their own frontiers. The bigger the challengeis, the greater is the opportunity. And they
                see it. Fear stops you in your tracks. Self-assurancepropels you forward. You have to believe in
                yourself, becauseit is hard to beat a person who never gives up. Strong-minded, resolutely-willed,
                you can create out of nothing animmensebusiness, a giganticempire, a New World!” his voice
                reverberated around the hall, as the promising youngsters sat there, their faces screwed up in
                concentration, clinging to every word that left his mouth, as if their life depended on it.
                Some had their camcorders out, others were moving their hands with such amazing speeds that their hands
                were a blur, writing down all that he said.
            </p>
            <p>
                His eyes lit up with pride and emotions.
            </p>
            <p>
                He stopped to catch his breath, before going on, slower this time, “Do you remember Martin Luther King
                Jr.?
                He had a dream. We all have dreams. But his dream, it was different. Why? Because he believed he could
                accomplish it, and he did. Do you remember Abraham Lincoln? Winston Churchill? Mahatma Gandhi? Mohammad
                Ali
                Jinnah? They all had one thing in common – determination, a determination that never faltered, a resolve
                that never wavered, and a will to attain what they sought. All who have accomplished great things have
                had
                a great aim; had fixed their gaze on a goal which was high, one which sometimes even seemed impossible.
                But
                they achieved it, simply by knowing that difference between the impossible and possible lies in a
                person's
                determination.”
            </p>
            <p>
                He had to stop, as the hall had once again burst into vigorous round of applause. It took them a moment
                to settle again. He sighed.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Leaders need to have influence on their people. What makes leadership is the ability to get people
                to do what they don't want to do, and like it. As a leader you should always start with where people are
                before you try to take them to where you want them to go. Just like a good manager is a man who isn't
                worried about his own career but rather the careers of those who work for him, a good leader is a man
                who rejoices the success of those who look up to him. A good leader is a man who brings people up - not
                down! A good leader is a man who seizes every opportunity to give encouragement, because encouragement
                is oxygen to the soul.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Whole room was lit by glares of flashlights, and he was, for an instant, blinded by the sudden onslaught
                from every direction. He closed his eyes, removed his eyeglasses, and wiped his forehead with the back
                of his wrinkled hand. Putting his glasses back on, he took a swig from the glass of water on the dais
                before him. Age had its tolls. His feet already felt heavier, but he smiled softly.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Leadership is not a one-day thing. It is a constant commitment to excellence, a habit . . . a daily
                practice. Challenge yourself all the days of your life. Plunge boldly into the thicket of life! Either
                find a way or make one. The will to win is worthless if you do not have the will to prepare. Lead by
                example! Exceed expectations! Move. Whatever it takes, just move! Don't let anything stop you.
            </p>
            <p>
                There will be times when you'll be disappointed, but you can't stop. Make yourself the very best that
                you can! The challenge may not be easy, but it is possible. What you need is boldness, more boldness,
                and always boldness!” and with that, he finished.
            </p>
            <p>
                As he turned around to make his way to his seat, the auditorium rang with fervent clapping and cheering.
                There were many flashes of light, again. It made him smile, broadly. He sat on his seat, thinking. He
                had done his job, and hopefully, his effort would not be fruitless. At 71, he was too old to take the
                job anymore. It was time of the young ones. They needed to be prepared, because their country needed
                them, and he had done something to contribute to the cause.
            </p>
            <p>
                When he exited the hall, an hour or so later, during which he had been asked for autographs quite a few
                times, he wore a satisfied grin on his face, which lit his face in a way that made him look ten years
                younger.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before the sun rose on the next day, the newsstands and the hawkers began selling the papers, and with
                those, came the shocking news, on the front page of every paper, right beneath the benevolently smiling
                face of Sir Thomas Abbot from the day before, of his demise.
            </p>
            <p>
                He had fallen asleep last night, content, satisfied, and hopeful, never to wake up again. That evening,
                the city’s graveyard witnessed the greatest service ever in the history, as hundreds of black-clad
                mourners gathered to see him to his very last abode, with eyes cast down, drenched in rain, which
                disguised the tears streaming down their faces. As the sun sat that day, the words,“Here lies Sir Thomas
                Abbot, the dreamer who left behind a legacy of true leadership” glowed blood-red in the departing rays.
