                                            30th October 2011. This was the day that changed my outlook on life and gave
                                            me an
                                            ambition.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            My whole thinking process was revolutionized, and I set afoot on a way that
                                            led me
                                            to a
                                            firmer
                                            belief in my own abilities, and shattered the idols of fear within my heart.
                                            I was
                                            politically
                                            aroused, and became part of a movement that had set out with a mission of
                                            saving my
                                            country, my
                                            Pakistan; a movement that aimed to scratch off the rust that was eating
                                            through the
                                            very
                                            soul
                                            of my country, and re-make it into what it was originally intended to be; a
                                            movement
                                            that had
                                            set out to make a Naya Pakistan!

                                            30th October 2011. This was the day when the wind of change began. And like
                                            thousands of
                                            Pakistanis, it roused me from my callous slumber.

                                        <p>
                                            I belong to a well-known political family of Southern Punjab, the Khichi
                                            family of
                                            the
                                            Chauhan
                                            Rajput clan, based in the Vehari district. For as long as the formation of
                                            Pakistan,
                                            my
                                            ancestors have been in and out of the ever-changing governments, holding at
                                            least
                                            one
                                            position
                                            of power at any given time. My family had taken an active part in Pakistan
                                            Movement
                                            and
                                            had
                                            associated itself strongly with Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, and his
                                            sister
                                            Fatima
                                            Jinnah
                                            after him. This led to an unconditional affiliation with All India Muslim
                                            League
                                            from
                                            the very
                                            beginning which after the demise of Fatima Jinnah, transformed into a
                                            loyalty for
                                            Pakistan
                                            Muslim League (Nawaz) and its chief Mian Nawaz Sharif for whatever reasons
                                            my
                                            forbearers
                                            had
                                            thought justified.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            From the time I was born, in the year 1995, I would hear the lion, symbol of
                                            Nawaz
                                            Sharifâ€™s
                                            political party, roaring in every corner of my household. My elders were
                                            always
                                            working
                                            with
                                            and singing praises of this PML-N and its chief, with my grandfather and
                                            later,
                                            uncle
                                            contesting and winning elections on PML-N tickets. I remember being inflated
                                            on
                                            seeing
                                            the lion
                                            symbolized beside the green posters, flyers and banners that bore the
                                            picture of my
                                            grandfather, Haji Mehmood Khan Khichi, for his election campaigns. Whenever
                                            someone
                                            alluded to
                                            the lion, my thoughts instantly wandered to the PML-N, such was the
                                            impression that
                                            had
                                            been
                                            ingrained on my mind by the conduct of my family. I considered Mian Nawaz
                                            Sharif as
                                            deserving
                                            to be Quaid-e-Azamâ€™s successor, and did not, at that time, even know that
                                            this PML-N
                                            was
                                            not
                                            really the same political party which Quaid-e-Azam had been a part of and
                                            which had
                                            played so
                                            vital a role in bringing about the existence of Pakistan.

                                            In the year 1999, when the then army chief, General Pervez Musharraf
                                            overthrew Nawaz
                                            Sharifâ€™s
                                            government and established himself as the sole head of the country, I was of
                                            a
                                            blithe
                                            age of
                                            four, and thus with little knowledge and interest in the matter. I knew
                                            nothing of
                                            and

                                            little for either politics, or history and current affairs. Mian Nawaz
                                            Sharif was
                                            expelled from
                                            Pakistan after a short term of imprisonment, and returned years after, on
                                            25th
                                            November
                                            2007.

                                            All these years, I listened to my familyâ€™s opinion on the matter routinely
                                            on dinner
                                            table; the
                                            shortcomings of Musharraf and his government, the [supposed] happy days of
                                            Nawaz
                                            Sharifâ€™s rule,
                                            and how Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) was the only political party working
                                            in the
                                            countryâ€™s
                                            interests. I had no opinion on the matter myself, for I gave it little
                                            importance
                                            and no
                                            thought at all. Naturally, I believed that my family had the right picture,
                                            and felt
                                            the
                                            same
                                            reverence for Nawaz Sharif that my family did.

                                            With the time being, my knowledge of the matters I previously knew little of
                                            was
                                            gradually
                                            increasing through the books I read and the conversations I now listened to
                                            with a
                                            greater
                                            interest and understanding. I was by now familiar with some history, and
                                            knew
                                            Zulfiqar
                                            Ali

                                            knew
                                            now that apart from being the Prime Minister twice, Nawaz Sharif had also
                                            been the
                                            Chief
                                            Minister of Punjab.

                                            Sometimes, when I spared a thought for the condition of the province that
                                            had been
                                            ruled
                                            by
                                            PML-N for about twenty years, I would see a huge question mark on
                                            eligibility of
                                            Nawaz

                                            as a ruler. Exposure to factors outside my family had enlightened me to the
                                            side of
                                            picture
                                            that had up to now remained obscure and my naturally-induced admiration of
                                            Mian
                                            Nawaz

                                            had somewhat diminished. But at twelve years of age, I was still too young
                                            to care
                                            about
                                            what
                                            sort of ruler Pakistan needed and question anyoneâ€™s eligibility.

                                            On 27th December 2007, only two months after her return, Benazir Bhutto was
                                            shot
                                            dead
                                            during a
                                            rally for upcoming general elections, in the same â€˜Liaquat Baghâ€™ of

                                            first
                                            Prime Minster of Pakistan Liaquat Ali Khan was martyred. Consequently, PPP
                                            won the
                                            general
                                            elections of 2008, as Benazirâ€™s martyrdom had diverted the nationâ€™s
                                            sympathies to
                                            the

                                            family which had suffered so much for [supposedly] the country. Benazirâ€™s
                                            husband,
                                            the
                                            notorious Asif Ali Zardari, whom many people suspected as having a hand in
                                            his
                                            wifeâ€™s
                                            fate,
                                            came up with her will which named him as the Chairman of Pakistan Peopleâ€™s
                                            Party (So
                                            much for
                                            being champions of democracy!). With the success of his party, he
                                            established
                                            himself as
                                            the
                                            President of Pakistan. Consider the irony; the person who was now the
                                            President of
                                            Pakistan was
                                            until now serving sentences in prisons for God knows what crimes he had
                                            committed.
                                            But
                                            instead
                                            of confronting the criminal who was now the President, Nawaz Sharif gave him
                                            free
                                            hand,
                                            and
                                            even helped him in any way he could (for the sake of democracy, of course)
                                            while the
                                            former
                                            plundered the country for next five years of his term. This made me realize
                                            more
                                            than
                                            anything
                                            that I was mistaken when I thought that Nawaz Sharif was working for the
                                            country. He
                                            served no
                                            oneâ€™s but his own interests, and wanted nothing but to keep his own self
                                            sated. Six
                                            years of
                                            exile had rusted Nawaz Sharifâ€™s politics, and to get it all shiny again, he
                                            befriended
                                            the
                                            husband of the woman who was his staunchest opponent, a person he knew to be
                                            clever,
                                            selfish
                                            crook. Nawaz Sharif consorted with the criminal he should have confronted,
                                            resorting
                                            to
                                            using
                                            the power of his brother Shahbaz Sharif who had been elected the Chief
                                            Minister of
                                            Punjab to
                                            loot their share of the plunder. This was selfishness at its peak, which no
                                            amount
                                            of
                                            justification from his supporters could veil from me. In the five years of
                                            Zardariâ€™s
                                            term,
                                            Nawaz Sharif gradually lost all the respect I had ever had for him.

                                            In younger days, I pictured Nawaz Sharif as leader, but now I realized that
                                            he too
                                            was
                                            and is
                                            only a politician; loyal to his own self alone, and wanting power not for

                                            profession; of course he considered politics a business too, and served only
                                            to
                                            increase

                                            PML-N had lost my respect, and the little respect I had for PPP died with
                                            Benazir
                                            Bhutto. Where
                                            I had been previously indifferent to politics, I now became averse to it. I
                                            wanted
                                            God
                                            to send
                                            someone who would change the countryâ€™s fate and make it what it was meant to
                                            be,
                                            someone
                                            who
                                            would use his power for the country and not for only himself.

                                            It seemed like God finally heard me out, when on 30th October 2011, I
                                            listened for
                                            the
                                            first
                                            time to a person who was the Chairman of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, a
                                            political party
                                            which had
                                            been formed in 1996 and about whose existence I was up to now oblivious. I
                                            knew him
                                            as
                                            the
                                            former Captain of Pakistan Cricket Team who had led his team to victory in
                                            the
                                            Cricket
                                            World
                                            Cup of 1992, and now I realized that he may be the person who was destined
                                            to lead
                                            Pakistan to
                                            another, much more desirable victory very soon. I chose him as my Captain
                                            when I
                                            found
                                            out how
                                            he considered Quaid-e-Azam his political role model and Allama Iqbal his
                                            ideological
                                            leader. He
                                            was Imran Khan!
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, the name was new to me. I knew Imran Khan as a
                                            cricketer,
                                            but
                                            was not
                                            aware of his role in politics. I had heard of Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer
                                            Hospital, a
                                            first-of-its-kind cancer hospital which ran on charity and treated thousands
                                            of
                                            cancer
                                            patients
                                            free of cost every year, but I did not know that Shaukat Khanum was Imran
                                            Khanâ€™s
                                            mother
                                            who had
                                            died of cancer, motivating her son to build an international standard
                                            hospital
                                            entirely
                                            on
                                            charity, with nothing but his will and trust on God, so that Pakistanis did
                                            not have
                                            to
                                            go
                                            abroad for cancer treatment. On 30th October 2011, when I saw him speaking
                                            at a
                                            mammoth
                                            gathering in Lahore, I instantly knew this was the person I was looking for.
                                            This
                                            was
                                            the
                                            person who will lead us out of this darkness. This was the person who was to
                                            be my
                                            leader, my
                                            Captain.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            It was the same place where Pakistan Resolution had been passed in 1940; the
                                            Manto
                                            Park
                                            of
                                            Lahore, the ground where Minar-e-Pakistan stands, reminding us of what
                                            Pakistan had
                                            been
                                            resolved to be. The ground was filled with millions of charged people of
                                            every age
                                            and
                                            shape,
                                            decked with red and green of PTIâ€™s flag. Imran Khan stepped up to the dais,
                                            and
                                            began;
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            <blockquote>
                                                In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Most Beneficent<br>
                                                Oh God, we kneel before you alone, and seek only your help
                                            </blockquote>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            He began with telling his audience that God had empowered them by giving
                                            them a free
                                            will, and
                                            if they intended to do something good, and strove for it, God will
                                            eventually give
                                            them
                                            success. He talked for three-quarters of an hour, and he spoke all my
                                            thoughts. By
                                            the
                                            end of
                                            his speech, I was convinced that if I wanted to see my country changed, Iâ€™d
                                            have to
                                            play
                                            a part
                                            in bringing about that change. As Imran Khan reminded his audience, God says
                                            in
                                            Quran
                                            that he
                                            does not change the fate of the nation which does not strive to change
                                            itself. I
                                            thought
                                            that
                                            if I remained silent any longer, Iâ€™d be equally responsible for the
                                            condition my
                                            country
                                            was
                                            in. My country needed me. Then I remembered Allama Iqbalâ€™s verse, in which
                                            he says;
                                        </p>

                                            Thus, from that time onwards, my indifference to politics turned into a
                                            fierce
                                            passion

                                            in
                                            thousands
                                            of
                                            youngsters like myself, and we had woken from our apathetic stupor. I had
                                            realized
                                            that
                                            it was
                                            the time to let go of the fears, believe in myself, and make myself useful.
                                            This was
                                            the
                                            change
                                            that Imran Khan had brought about, and with the sleeping youth rising, I
                                            could see
                                            Pakistan on
                                            the doorstep of a revolution.
