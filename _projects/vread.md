If you're a bookworm, then vRead is the social network for you! It's a mobile-first platform that allows users to connect with their fellow bookaholics and exchange digital books. You can also use it to track your own reading activity and see what your friends are reading.

Plus, it's a great place to get recommendations for new reads, manage your digital library, and exchange digital books with your friends.

## Key Features

The vRead app is a great way to read books digitally. You can search for books in an extensive catalogue, preview the contents of a book, track your reading activity, and write reviews for books you have read. Additionally, you can create a personal library for your digital books and lend digital books to your friends.

Some of the key features include:

1. Book search by title, author, ISBN, etc.
2. Preview book samples.
3. Track reading activity.
4. Book reviews.
5. Manage owned books.
6. Borrow and lend digital books.

Overall, vRead is a great app that provides many features that make reading digitally more enjoyable.

## Supported Platforms

This is a web application with a mobile-first interface.

## Programming Languages

The back-end is developed using PHP language with a MySQL database. The front-end uses HTML and JavaScript along with jQuery and Bootstrap frameworks.

JavaScript

## Updates

I am in the process of migrating the database to Firebase, and front-end to Google's Material Components and JavaScript. Laravel framework is used for the backend.

> <p>Goodreads recently deprecated its Developer API without warning. I took this as an opportunity to update an old project of mine from 2017 with new Material theme, and Google Books API instead.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PHP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PHP</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Laravel?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Laravel</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysOfCode?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#100DaysOfCode</a> <a href="https://t.co/5FzsZAsX8O">pic.twitter.com/5FzsZAsX8O</a></p>
