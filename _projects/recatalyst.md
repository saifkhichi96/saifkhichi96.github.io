RECatalyst is a mobile-based Requirements Engineering tool that helps project teams collaborate during different phases of the software development lifecycle. It specifically focuses on Requirements Engineering, which is the process of identifying, analyzing, and documenting requirements for software. RECatalyst makes it easy for team members to share and discuss requirements with each other by providing a convenient and easy-to-use interface. This allows projects to move more smoothly from start to finish, with fewer bumps in the road caused by miscommunication or lack of collaboration.

## Key Features

Some of the key features of the app include:

### 1. Project Management

Manage projects you are working on, add team members to your projects, share project resources with each other, and track deadlines and pending tasks. This allows project managers to ensure that their projects run smoothly and are completed on time.

### 2. Team Collaboration

Project collaboration tools allow team members to chat in real-time about projects, assign tasks to other team members, and share files and documents. This allows for a more efficient way for teams to communicate and work together on projects.


### 3. Direct Messaging

With Direct Messaging, you can easily chat with your connections about anything you want without having to create a new project just for chatting purposes! This is a great way to stay in touch and keep up with what's going on with your connections. Plus, it's a convenient way to communicate privately without having to send emails or messages through other platforms.


### 4. Deadlines and Tasks

Deadlines and tasks are important aspects of any project. By tracking deadlines and tasks, you can ensure that all aspects of the project are completed on time. Additionally, by assigning tasks to specific team members, you can ensure that everyone is aware of their role in the project.


### 5. Documentation Generation

The built-in document editor in our app enables you to create RE (Requirements) documents for your projects. This eliminates the need for separate tools or applications, and provides a more efficient and streamlined workflow.
