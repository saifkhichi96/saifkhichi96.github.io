The gameplay consists of a very basic Snakes and Ladders board with two players. One player is controlled by the user, while the other player is automated.

Each player rolls a dice one after the other. If a player rolls a 6, then they get to roll the dice again. The goal is to reach the 100th position on the board first, while avoiding any snakes on the way. If a player lands at the head of a snake, the snake "bites" the player and the player is transferred to the tail position of the snake. If a player lands at the base of a ladder, the player can "climb" the ladder and be transferred to the top of the ladder.
