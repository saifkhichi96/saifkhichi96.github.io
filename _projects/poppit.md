The faster you pop the balloons, the more points you earn. Poppit! is a fun and challenging game that will keep you entertained for hours on end. The players can see how they rank against others in the public leaderboards. This allows them to compare their skills and progress with other players.

There are different game modes, including tap, shoot and blow. In the tap mode, you have to touch the balloon to pop them. The shoot mode is just like it sounds – you have to use your finger to aim and shoot arrows at moving balloons. And in the blow mode, you have to use your device’s microphone to blow air into balloons until they get big enough and pop. In each game mode, your goal is to pop as many balloons as you can before the clock strikes zero.
