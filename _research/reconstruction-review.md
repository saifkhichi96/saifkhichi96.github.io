title: 3D Reconstruction from a Single RGB Image&#58; A Review
description: This paper reviews recent deep learning based monocular 3D reconstruction methods for textured and texture-less surfaces.
abstract: 3D reconstruction from a single 2D input is a classic problem in the field of computer vision. With the advancements in deep learning, the performance of 3D reconstruction has also significantly improved. The reconstruction task is more difficult for objects with no textures or complex deformations. This paper serves as a review of recent literature on 3D reconstruction from a single view, with a focus on deep learning methods from 2018 to 2021. Due to lack of standard datasets or 3D shape representation methods, it is hard make direct comparisons between all reviewed methods. However, this paper reviews different approaches for reconstructing 3d shape as depth maps, surface normals, point clouds and meshes; along with various loss functions and evaluation metrics used to train and evaluate these methods.
